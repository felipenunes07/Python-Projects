<p>The course consists mainly of exercises and is focused on practical learning.</p><p>This is the moment when a novice programmer can test skills on real problems.</p><p>I encourage you to do the exercises yourself. Make mistakes and fix them. Search technical documentation and forums. Use services such as <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong>. This is an integral part of the programmer's work. The ability to search for valuable information or solve complex problems is crucial. Critical thinking also. Fortunately, you can learn it.</p><p>Good luck, have fun &amp; happy coding! :)</p>
