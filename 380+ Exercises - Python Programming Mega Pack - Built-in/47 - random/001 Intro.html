MODULE REFERENCE

    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the

DESCRIPTION
        integers
        --------
               uniform within range
    
        sequences
        ---------
               pick random element
               pick random sample
               pick weighted random sample
               generate random permutation
    
        distributions on the real line:
        ------------------------------
               uniform
               triangular
               normal (Gaussian)
               lognormal
               negative exponential
               gamma
               beta
               pareto
               Weibull
    
        distributions on the circle (angles 0 to 2pi)
        ---------------------------------------------
               circular uniform

    General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:
    
    * The period is 2**19937-1.
    * It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
    * The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
      and is, therefore, threadsafe.</pre>
